# Hey there!

I'm **megamaz** and I code in [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Brainfuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcHaMWktCYE&ab_channel=623), [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), and started coding in [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
#### I am putting this one on DISPLAY!! I am so happy to have found my [first python code](https://gist.github.com/megamaz/13055e5e85b2aea66812d22e40830063)!
<!-- ### My [GitHub Page](https://megamaz.github.io) -->

My main project at the Moment is [PNEE](https://github.com/megamaz/noodleextensions-python), a python Beat Saber Noodle Extensions editor (library) that can be imported into your script. It's got a few bugs, so if you run into any LET ME KNOW! Either open an issue or let me know on discord through `megamaz#1020`.

 Here are my gists:
1. [My first python code](https://gist.github.com/megamaz/13055e5e85b2aea66812d22e40830063)!
1. [Calculator in Python](https://gist.github.com/megamaz/82a49eefb634c1afebcf0c6ea7a9425d) My first python project.
1. [Webcheck](https://gist.github.com/megamaz/54ea880af345177544a9fa8914a57635) Checks the website status
1. [Graph](https://gist.github.com/megamaz/8f27b94b31b6609be8a0f826ac93fd8e) [BAD] Do not use this. Original goal was to make a python library, obvious fail.
1. "[The Way](https://gist.github.com/megamaz/41cfb50c3779f32018119f9e9ff540c1)" Quick Game I made in python. Just sit back and watch it play.
1. [Card Game](https://gist.github.com/megamaz/6eb2d00c5c9d8a6b7e6a36cc3478cb7c)
